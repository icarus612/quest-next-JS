Feel free to use it and change it how you like - Quest operates under MIT licence. To see a preview just open the download and run "npm run start". This is built using facebooks create-react-app, and hosted using netlifys amazing free services. Quest takes advantage of several external libraries including Bootstrap, and Anime.js, and of course React. It also takes advantage of a another repo made by myself called dots.
